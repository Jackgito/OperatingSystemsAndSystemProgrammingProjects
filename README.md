Project1: Warmup to C and Unix programming
The program is designed to reverse the order of lines in a text file.
It can be used with different command-line options to read from standard input, read from a specified input file, or read from an input file and write the reversed content to an output file.
The program dynamically allocates memory to handle varying line lengths and includes error handling. 

Project2: Unix Utilities
Includes programs that mimic the original commands of Linux terminal, like cat, grep and zip/unzip.

Project3: Unix Shell
Simple shell with few custom commands
